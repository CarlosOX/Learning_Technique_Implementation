# Learning_Technique_Implementation
Implementing a Learning Technique without using frameworks.

For this proyect i created a linear regression technique using a dataset from kaggle where i didn't use frameworks such as tenserflow or scikit-learn. 
I made use of POO paradigm, pandas and numpy library in order to program the algorithm from scratch. In addition, i used matplotlib to visualize 
the results of the implementation. 

The dataset used to test the algorithm is meant to predict the relation between heigth and weight of olympic athletes.
